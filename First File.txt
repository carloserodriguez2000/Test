This is the first file test for Test repository.

  Once upon a time I was a Software Engineer and then I was not. Like a frog being slowly warmed in a pot of water to the point of boiling and not even noticing.  It happends in many aspects of like. 

  Life happends and it should not be. The world moves by inputs a waves of the world collective. All inclusive of people, plants, animals and cosmic rays.

  They all are continuosly notching you in all directions. But never forget that you are in the driver seat. Corrections must be made all the time to stay focused on what you want from live. Stear all the time with purpose. Otherwise you will end up being a frog but a boiled frog.  Not very usefull as a frog anymore other than for a quick snack.

Sincerely
Carlos E Rodriguez.  (the frog that jumped out of the hot water before it killed me)
